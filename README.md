# MATLAB Codes

This repository contains MATLAB files focusing on various studies and simulations related to electrical circuits and control systems. Each file serves as an educational resource, demonstrating the theoretical and practical aspects of different topics.

## Introduction

This repository provides a collection of MATLAB scripts that explore and analyze:

- RLC circuits
- Time-domain specifications of second-order systems
- Transfer functions (open-loop and closed-loop)
- Mass-spring-damper systems

These files are useful for students, researchers, and engineers looking to understand the dynamics and control of electrical and mechanical systems.

## Files Description

1. **Study of RLC Circuit**  
   Analyzes the behavior of an RLC circuit, showcasing its transient and steady-state responses.

2. **Study of RLC Circuit with Inputs**  
   Simulates an RLC circuit with various input signals to study the system's response under different conditions.

3. **Time Domain Specifications**  
   Computes time-domain specifications such as rise time, peak time, settling time, and overshoot for second-order systems.

4. **Transfer Function (Open Loop)**  
   Demonstrates the derivation and analysis of an open-loop transfer function for a control system.

5. **Transfer Function (Closed Loop)**  
   Focuses on closed-loop transfer functions, showing the impact of feedback on system stability and performance.

6. **Transfer Functions Mass Spring Damper**  
   Models and analyzes a mass-spring-damper system using transfer functions to explore its dynamic behavior.

7. **Transfer Functions Plot**  
   Visualizes transfer functions to help understand the frequency response and stability characteristics of systems.
